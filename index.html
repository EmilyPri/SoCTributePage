If you own Za’atar, have ever shopped for pomegranate molasses, or have Googled ‘substitute Dolcelatte’, chances are, you have Yotam Ottolenghi to thank. Born in Jerusalem in the late 1960s, Ottolenghi is widely credited with popularising Middle Eastern flavours in the UK, and with good reason. Read on for a whistlestop tour of the chef's rise to culinary domination:
</p>
<p><strong class="brown-writing">Late 1990s</strong> Ottolenghi moves to London, where he studies French pastry cooking at Le Cordon Bleu cookery school. 
 </p>
 <p><strong class="brown-writing">1999</strong> Whilst working as head pastry chef at Baker and Spice, Ottolenghi meets and becomes firm friends with Palestinian Chef Sami Tamimi. The two share a language- Hebrew- and a love of dramatic flavours.  
 </p>
<p><strong class="brown-writing">2002</strong> Alongside Tamimi, Ottolenghi opens his eponymous deli in Notting Hill, serving deli food and pastries. It is now just one of six popular Ottolenghi delis in London. 
 </p>
<p><strong class="brown-writing">2011</strong> NOPI, the chef's first restaurant, opens in central London.  
 </p>
<p><strong class="brown-writing">2012</strong> Ottolenghi and Tamimi's recipe book, <em>Jerusalem</em>, is published to commerical and critical acclaim. It wins the James Beard Award for International Cooking and contains recipes including this <a href="https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/roast-butternut-squash-and-red-onion-with-tahini-and-za-atar" id="tribute-link"target="_blank"> roast butternut squash and red onion salad </a>.  
 </p>
<p><strong class="brown-writing">2018</strong> A busy year sees both the publication of best-selling recipe book <em>Simple</em> and the opening of vegetable-centric new restaurant ROVI.
